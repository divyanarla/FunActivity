My name is Divya Bharathi Narla and I have just been hired as an Associate Software Engineer here at Navitaire.
I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself and say hello. I moved to the United States from India in the beginning of this year, so this is my first job here. ? 

Before joining Navitaire, I was working as a Software Analyst at Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) in India on Scandinavian Airlines Project’s for 3 years. 

While I am not working I love spending my time cooking, watching movies and listening to music. I am in love with Salt Lake and really like the warmth that people show here.

I´m very enthusiastic and excited to join Navitaire and I anticipate working with all of you efficiently, learning from your experiences and contributing to the company’s success.
 making friends. 
Thanks to everyone for being so welcoming.

Divya.
